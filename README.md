# Do Together
An app where people can do something together

* Share a link with your friend(s) - No logins
* Once your friend(s) joins that link, you should be able to set a goal + timer indicating what you want to do. These can be same or multiple things. 
* The timer is the only thing thats common for everyone - can be controlled (play/pause/end) by owner of the link.
